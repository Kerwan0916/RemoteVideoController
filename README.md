# RemoteVideoController

A node.js based Remote connecting your phone to your laptop and allowing you to play a video from your phone, enabling an interactive presentation framework, where users can start the video whenever they want to.

To start in current state :
Step 1 : start the server in your terminal or command line with : node server.js

Step 2 : connect your phone to the same wifi as your computer hosting the server

Step 3 : open the controller on your phone's browser with the url : http://yourIpAddress:3000/controller.html

Step 4 : open the video player on your computer browser with the url : http://yourIpAddress:3000/video.html

(I'm currently working on automating the last step when you start up the server)
